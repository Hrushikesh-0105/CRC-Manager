Overview
CRC Manager is an app designed for managing classroom bookings in a university's Classroom Complex (CRC). In this system, professors act as admins who handle the classroom booking requests from students. Once a student requests a classroom for an event, the professor approves the booking through the app. The CRC guard, responsible for key distribution, receives an OTP once the booking is confirmed. When the student enters the OTP, the guard releases the keys to the classroom, ensuring secure access for events. This system streamlines classroom management and access control while improving overall efficiency.
